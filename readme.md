# AI Flight Academy

A two-hour hands-on agent-building session for Global Skilling Team Week.

Three scenarios, each buildable at three altitudes, so everyone works on the same problem at the level that suits them.

| | Scenario | What you build |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧬 | **The Digital Twin** | A portable spec of how you work, saved as a skill |
| 🎛️ | **Dispatch** | A room of teams that routes a skilling request |
| 🎖️ | **The Ambassador** | A cohort picker that shows the evidence behind its choices |

| | Altitude | Built with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 | **Cowork** | Microsoft Copilot + Cowork |
| 🔵 | **Scout** | Microsoft Scout |
| 🟣 | **Code** | VS Code + GitHub Copilot, or the Copilot CLI |
