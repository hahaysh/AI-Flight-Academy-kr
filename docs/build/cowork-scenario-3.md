# The Ambassador

## Objectives

Contoso's AI Skilling Ambassador program is a group of volunteers who help colleagues use the company's AI tools - running office hours, mentoring, answering questions, and writing the guides everyone leans on, all on top of their day jobs. Each round the program brings in eight new ambassadors, chosen from people across nine regions already doing some of this informally.

The **Ambassador skill** was built to take some of that work off whoever runs the round, and it isn't finished. It reads a short written description of what the program looks for, applies it to every candidate, and returns eight names with a reason for each. It's fast and confident, and it can't show you the evidence behind any of it - so nobody can check whether those reasons hold up.

In this activity you run that skill, change what it looks for, and then start extending it. Three steps:

| | Step | You're done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Upload and run** | Cowork has the Ambassador skill loaded and returns eight names from the program data. |
| **2** | **Change what it looks for** | You've swapped the written description of what the program wants, re-run, and seen different names come back. |
| **3** | **Extend it** | The skill does something it couldn't before. |

Step 3 is the main build, and it isn't one change. Close a gap, re-run, see what moved, then close the next one.

**The skill proposes. A person decides.** The eight names are a recommendation someone has to act on, so every change you make should make that person's job easier: more evidence on screen, clearer reasoning, a faster way to overrule it.

::: details Glossary

- **Skill:** a folder of plain-text instructions Cowork loads and follows. You can read it and edit it.
- **Cohort:** the group of eight the program brings in each round. Picking the next one is the job.
- **Candidate:** one of the volunteers the program could bring in. Not an applicant - 31 of the 72 never put themselves forward.
- **Definition:** the written description of what the program is looking for. The skill applies it to every candidate. Editing it is how you change the result.
- **Shortlist:** the eight names the skill returns. A proposal for a person to act on, not a decision.
- **Evidence:** the records behind a claim - what someone ran, the feedback they got, what they contributed.

For more definitions, see the [Glossary](/glossary).

Open Cowork. You'll add the Ambassador skill in Step 1. Nothing here needs code - every change is a sentence typed into the chat. The CSVs you attach travel with your prompt to the model, which is why the data is fictional.

**The data is fictional.** Invented people, invented scores, invented feedback. Nothing here describes a real person and no real program is being modeled.

What's in the skill:

```text
ambassador/
  SKILL.md              the instructions Cowork loads and follows
  references/
    DEFINITION.md       what the program looks for. This is the file you edit
    PLAYBOOK.md         how the program describes itself
  definitions/          three worked alternatives - reach, depth, rising
```

::: tip When you're stuck, ask Cowork
You're building with Cowork, so it can also fix what you're building. Paste the error, or describe what came back wrong. Coaches are in the room if that doesn't land.

---

## 1 · Upload and run

**Done when:** Cowork returns eight names from the program data.

1. In Cowork, open **Customize** → the arrow next to **Add** → **Upload**, and drag in `ambassador-skill.zip` (or the unzipped folder - Cowork takes either).

   ::: warning Upload the whole zip, not just SKILL.md
   `SKILL.md` is only the instructions. The zip also carries `references/` and `definitions/`, which hold the definition it runs on, the playbook, and the three alternatives.
   :::

   ![The Cowork Customize page, with Customize in the left menu, the Add dropdown open, and Upload highlighted](/img/cowork-upload-skill.png)

1. Start a **new** Cowork session. Skills load only when a session starts.

1. Unzip `ambassador-program-data.zip` and drag in **all nine CSVs** to the session - the `.csv` files only, not the two markdown files beside them.

1. Ask Cowork to run it. Start every request with *"Using the ambassador skill"* - that's how Cowork knows to call it.

   ```text
   Using the ambassador skill, who should be in the next cohort?
   ```

   You should see 8 names appear.

   **Those eight are a first guess, not an answer.** The skill judged everyone on seven summary scores and nothing else, and those scores are invented - some of them deliberately misleading. Finding where the list is wrong is the rest of the exercise.

## 2 · Change what it looks for

**Done when:** a different definition has given you a different shortlist.

The skill judges every candidate against `DEFINITION.md` - a few sentences of plain text saying what the program wants. Swap that file and the answer changes.

Three alternative definitions ship with it: `reach.md` (work that gets reused), `depth.md` (one-to-one support), and `rising.md` (trajectory over standing).

```text
Using the ambassador skill, use definitions/depth.md as the definition instead. Re-run and tell me which names changed.
```

Then try `definitions/rising.md`. Same candidates, different results - and you changed it by swapping a paragraph of text, not by touching code.

::: tip Cowork may ask before it changes a file
When a prompt makes Cowork edit a file - the definition, a reference - it often shows you the change and waits for you to approve it. Approve it, or the change won't happen. If you aren't asked, that's fine too; check the result and keep going.
:::

## 3 · Extend it

**Done when:** the skill does something it couldn't before.

`program-data` has nine files. The skill only reads one of them, `CandidateProfiles.csv`, a summary of seven scores per person. The other eight are sitting there unused: what people actually ran, what colleagues said, what they left behind, who applied. Tell the skill to read those too and the shortlist changes.

That's one gap. There are others.

::: tip 🎈 Start small
Nothing has to be perfect or finished. Get the smallest version working, then build on it. Time and token budget are the real limits - so aim at something you can show, not something you can finish.

## Stuck?

| What you're seeing | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Cowork ignores the skill | Start a **new** Cowork session. Skills load only when a session starts. Begin your request with *"using the ambassador skill"*. |
| Upload didn't work | Give it the zip or the whole unzipped folder - not `SKILL.md` on its own. |
| Cowork can't find the data | Attach all nine CSVs to the session. Cowork only sees what you attach. |
| The same eight names every time | Check Cowork is reading the definition you edited. Ask it to show you the definition it just used. |
| A claim with no record behind it | Ask which file and row it came from. If it can't answer, it guessed - tell it to say so instead. |
| It changed more than you asked | Ask what it changed and why. Reject the change and try again with a narrower ask. |
