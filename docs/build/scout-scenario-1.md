# The Digital Twin

## Objectives

Scout can already read your mail, your calendar, and your files. What it can't do is any of it **as you** - decide which of two priorities wins, hold back the thing you'd check first, write differently to your manager than to a partner team. So every chat starts with you re-explaining yourself, and you rewrite most of what comes back.

Your **digital twin** is exactly that, written down and saved as a skill. You don't write it from scratch: Scout drafts it from your own mail, calendar, and Teams, and you correct what it got wrong. From then on, everything you create with Scout starts already knowing you.

In this activity you set up a twin, correct what it got wrong, and put it to work on something real. Three steps:

| | Step | You're done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Set it up** | Scout has written `persona.md` and `voice.md` from your work, and shown you what landed in your mail and Teams. |
| **2** | **Correct it** | You've changed two or three lines and watched an answer change because of it. |
| **3** | **Extend it** | The twin does something it couldn't before. |

Steps 1 and 2 are quick - about 20 minutes together. Step 3 is the main build, and it isn't one change: extend it, re-run, see what moved, then extend it again.

**Your twin is yours.** It reads only what you can already see, and the files it writes stay on your machine. When you compare with your table, share **the prompt that worked, not your mailbox** - a prompt carries none of your inbox with it.

::: details Glossary

- **Digital twin:** what Scout needs to know to act as you - how you decide, how you write, who you answer to. It lives in two text files you own and can edit.
- **Skill:** a folder of plain-text instructions Scout loads and follows. Your twin is one.
- **`persona.md`:** who you serve, what wins when priorities collide, what you check before committing.
- **`voice.md`:** how you write, plus a few of your own messages kept word for word.
- **Triage:** sorting what arrived into what needs you, what's waiting on someone else, and what doesn't.

For more definitions, see the [Glossary](/glossary).

## Before you start

**Check Scout is signed in and Work IQ is live.** Ask *"what's on my calendar tomorrow?"* - a real answer means you're ready. If not, grab a coach.

## 1 · Set it up

**Done when:** Scout has written `persona.md` and `voice.md` from your work, and shown you what landed.

1. Unzip the download. You'll get a folder called `my-twin`.

1. In Scout, open **Extensions** → **Import** and drag in the `my-twin` **folder** - the one with `SKILL.md` inside.

   ::: warning Import the folder, not the file
   `SKILL.md` isn't the whole skill. Templates and a worked example sit beside it, and dragging the file alone leaves them behind.
   :::

1. Start a **new chat**. Skills load when a chat begins.

1. Ask it to set itself up.

   ```text
   Set up my twin.
   ```

   It tells you what it's about to read and waits for a yes, then reads your sent mail, Teams messages, and about a month of calendar. It drafts two files with the evidence under each line, then triages what actually landed - so you leave setup having watched it work.

## 2 · Correct it

**Done when:** you've changed two or three lines and watched an answer change.

Your twin's first read of you is close, not right. It's built from what your work *proves*, which isn't the same as what you'd say about yourself.

1. **Ask it something real** - *"using my twin, what should I do about [the thing I've been putting off]?"* Lead with the twin's name; a generic answer usually means Scout didn't call it.
1. **Find what's off.** When an answer isn't yours, ask which rule made it say that, or ask to see your persona.
1. **Fix two or three lines, then move on.** Tell it what to change in your own words, then ask your question again. A good line changes what the twin *does* - a name, a date, a hard no.

Don't try to finish this. You'll keep correcting it while you build.

::: tip 🏷️ Give it a name you'll actually use
Say *"rename my twin to Clippy"* - or whatever you want to call it - then start a new chat so Scout picks it up. You'll be talking to this thing all afternoon; "using my twin" gets old.
:::

::: details More things to try, and what the tags mean

Start every one of these with your twin's name. Drop the name and Scout answers as itself.

| Ask something like | You get |
| --- | --- |
| *"Clippy, triage what landed today."* | Mail and Teams sorted into needs-me, blocked, handled, and noise, with drafts |
| *"Clippy, draft a reply to [a real thread]."* | Something you could send, in your voice |
| *"Clippy, what am I forgetting this week?"* | Your calendar and your commitments read together |
| *"Clippy, what don't you know about how I work?"* | Its own gaps, named - it's read a month of your work |

Every section of your persona is tagged by how directly the twin knows it:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `[observed]` | Found in your mail, chats, or calendar, and the twin can quote it |
| `[inferred]` | A reasonable read, but you never said it outright |
| `[needs you]` | Nothing in your work reached this, so it wrote a starting point |

`[inferred]` and `[needs you]` are likeliest to be wrong. Start there.
:::

## 3 · Extend it

**Done when:** the twin does something it couldn't before.

Right now the twin answers questions. It doesn't run on its own, doesn't remember what you told it last time, and only knows what your mail and calendar happened to show. Building on it is how that changes.

::: tip 🎈 Start small
Nothing has to be perfect or finished. Get the smallest version working, then build on it. Time and token budget are the real limits - so aim at something you can show, not something you can finish.

## Stuck?

| What you're seeing | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Scout ignores the twin | Start a new chat. Skills load only when a chat starts. Begin your request with *"using my twin"*. |
| Import didn't work | Unzip first, then import the `my-twin` **folder** - not the zip, and not `SKILL.md` on its own. |
| Setup can't read your mail | Check Work IQ is connected - ask *"what's on my calendar tomorrow?"* and see if you get a real answer. |
| The answers don't sound like you | Ask which rule made it say that, then fix that line. Vague lines change nothing - name a person, a date, a hard no. |
| It's writing about you, not as you | Your persona is describing rather than instructing. "Sam is detail-oriented" changes nothing; "number first, no hedging" changes the next draft. |
| It changed more than you asked | Ask what it changed and why. Undo the parts you didn't want, then make one change at a time. |
