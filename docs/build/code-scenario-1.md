# The Digital Twin

## Objectives

You already know how you work. Which trade-off you make when two things conflict, what you check before you commit, how the wording changes between a partner team and your own.

None of that is written down anywhere an agent can reach. So it only gets applied while you're sitting there applying it.

Here you turn it into a skill an agent can load. Once an agent can reach your twin, it can ask at commit time, on a schedule, or mid-task - and get back what you would have said.

In this activity you set it up, confirm it answers, and extend it. Three steps:

| | Step | You're done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Set it up** | `copilot skill list` shows `my-twin` under Project skills. |
| **2** | **Ask your twin** | `python twin.py "..."` returns a position and the `persona.md` rule behind it. |
| **3** | **Extend it** | The twin does something it couldn't before. |

Steps 1 and 2 are quick - about 15 minutes together. Step 3 is the main build, and it isn't one change: extend it, re-run, see what moved, then extend it again.

::: details Glossary

- **Digital twin:** what an agent needs to know to answer as you - how you decide, how you write, the bar you hold work to. It lives in a few text files you own and can edit.
- **Skill:** a folder of plain-text instructions a Copilot surface loads and follows. Your twin is one, and it lives in `.github/skills/`.
- **`persona.md`:** who you serve, what wins when priorities collide, what you check before committing.
- **`standards.md`:** the bar you judge work against - swap it for whatever your domain actually is.
- **`ask_json()`:** the call to use when a *program* reads the answer. It returns a parsed object; prose is useless to a parser.

For more definitions, see the [Glossary](/glossary).

## Before you start

Build with whichever GitHub Copilot surface you like - VS Code, the Copilot CLI, or the GitHub Copilot app.

::: warning The twin comes pre-populated with fictional data
You don't need to write a persona today. The starter ships as **Jordan Reyes**, a made-up engineer at a fictional company, so it answers on the first command and nothing of yours goes into a shared exercise. Everything you build runs against Jordan - unless you take the optional step below to use your own.

`DISCLAIMER.md` in the starter lists what's invented, and how to point the twin at your own work after the session.

## 1 · Set it up

**Done when:** `copilot skill list` shows `my-twin` under Project skills.

1. Unzip the starter and open the folder in the Copilot surface you prefer. You'll also need a terminal open inside it. **Every command on this page runs from inside `twin-code-starter/`**:

   ```bash
   cd twin-code-starter
   copilot skill list
   ```

   `my-twin` appears under **Project skills** - the CLI finds `.github/skills/` in the current folder, so it only shows up when your terminal is in the starter. There's nothing to register.

```text
twin-code-starter/
  .github/skills/my-twin/     the twin. Every Copilot surface finds it here
    SKILL.md                  how it answers
    references/
      persona.md              how Jordan decides
      voice.md                how Jordan writes
      standards.md            the bar for judging work (swap for your domain)
      memory.md               a dated log it reads before recurring work, and writes after
  twin.py                     ask the twin, from Python
  onboard.py                  make it yours: an interview that replaces Jordan
  examples/                   review a diff, decide anything, triage an inbox, draft a status
  mcp_server.py               the twin as MCP tools
```

You'll work in two places side by side:

| | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| **A terminal** in `twin-code-starter/` | Running the twin from code - `python twin.py` and the examples. This is what you're building: something that works without a chat window. |
| **Your Copilot surface** | Getting Copilot to write and change that code with you. |

## 2 · Ask your twin

**Done when:** `python twin.py "..."` returns a position and the rule behind it.

1. **In the terminal**, run one question to confirm everything works - Python, the Copilot CLI, and your sign-in:

   ```bash
   python twin.py "Using my twin: a teammate is blocked on my review but I'm mid-migration. What do I do?"
   ```

   You'll get a position and the rule from `persona.md` or `standards.md` that produced it. Each call takes 20-60 seconds - it's a full agent turn, not a hang. That's the whole loop; the `examples/` folder shows what you can build on it, and each direction below points at one.

::: tip Asking in chat works too
Ask the same question in your Copilot surface's chat and the twin answers there as well. In chat it also adds one dated line to `references/memory.md` - that's by design, so it remembers the call next time. Still make sure the terminal command above works. The code you build calls the twin the same way, so if it works in the terminal, it will work in your code.
:::

::: details Optional · Use your own work instead of Jordan (about 10-15 minutes)
Skip this if you'd rather get straight to building - everything on this page works with Jordan.

1. **Run the interview:** `python onboard.py`. Answer a handful of short questions and it writes your own `persona.md`, `voice.md`, and `standards.md`. It runs locally and sends nothing anywhere. Jordan's files are backed up as `*.jordan.md`, so you can compare or switch back.
2. **Deepen it from your real work (optional).** Open one of the new files in a Copilot surface that can see your mail and calendar, and ask it to fill in a thin section from how you actually work. Correct what it drafts.
3. **Re-run your question** with `python twin.py` and check the answer now sounds like you.

Keep your own files local - nothing personal belongs in a shared repo. `DISCLAIMER.md` has the detail.
:::

## 3 · Extend it

**Done when:** the twin does something it couldn't before.

Now make your twin better: extend the skill so it works the way you want. Pick a direction with your table and build in small steps.

::: tip Prompts are examples, not scripts
Copilot writes the code with you. Describe what you want, run it, and correct what comes back - that's the skill here. Anything on this page phrased as a prompt is a starting point; say it your way.

**Ground it in your real work with Work IQ.** The twin reads static files today, and it answers as Jordan until you run `python onboard.py` to swap in your own persona (the optional step in Setup) - do that first, or you're feeding your real mail to a made-up engineer. Then, to answer from your actual mail, calendar, Teams, and files, connect the [Work IQ MCP server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/work-iq/mcp/overview) - an existing Microsoft server, so there's nothing to build. It's the same Work IQ the Cowork and Scout altitudes use, reachable here as a tool. For other capabilities, the [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) is worth a browse before you write a server of your own.

::: tip 🎈 Start small
Nothing has to be perfect or finished. Get the smallest version working, then build on it. Time and token budget are the real limits - so aim at something you can show, not something you can finish.

## Stuck?

| What you're seeing | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `copilot: command not found` | The Copilot CLI isn't installed or isn't signed in. The starter calls it behind the scenes, so `twin.py` can't run without it. |
| `my-twin` isn't in `copilot skill list` | Your terminal isn't in `twin-code-starter/`. The CLI finds `.github/skills/` in the current folder only - `cd` into the starter. |
| `python: command not found` | Try `py` instead on Windows. You need Python 3.10+. |
| A call seems to hang | It isn't hanging. Each call is a full agent turn - 20 to 60 seconds. If you're calling per-file or in a loop, stop and bound it to one input. |
| Your script can't parse the answer | You used `ask()`, which returns prose. Use `ask_json()` when a program reads the result. |
| The answers don't sound like anyone | That's Jordan, the fictional engineer the starter ships with. Run `python onboard.py` to replace him with your own persona. |
| It changed more than you asked | Ask Copilot what it changed and why. Undo the parts you didn't want, then make one change at a time. |
